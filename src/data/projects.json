        "longDescription": "SWEETS hotel is a new hotel concept in Amsterdam which consists of 28 different bridge houses, scattered across the city. The bridge houses were built in the 17th century to control the city's waterways and are now converted into hotel suites. The website is a key element of the brand identity. It is designed to be a digital experience that reflects the unique character of the hotel. I was in charge of overseeing the project from the initial concept to the final delivery. I worked closely with the design and development teams to ensure the project was delivered on time and on budget.",
